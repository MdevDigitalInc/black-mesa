#[ Black Mesa ] :8ball:
---

Black Mesa aims to be a ready-to-deploy barebones boilerplate for web applications of small to medium size without any modification. It features: a full webpack 2.0 implementation with *linting, testing, internationalization, browser-caching, state management, authentication (firebase) and .gz compression.*

Support for large traffic or bigger applications can easily be added since the architecture is built on scaleable principles with modular components throughout.

*Powered by Node.js and Vue.js*

##:beers:Philosophy
The main philosophy behind this project and why it was born is quite simple. Providing a quick and clean reactive/SPA deployment that can be setup quickly by any individual or team and that will auto-enforce best practices and QA. With the hope that *Fast deployment + Best practices* = less bugs and better quality. And we all know that less bugs = more :beers:

###Jack In A Box - The Good Kind.
BlackMesa can be deployed by cloning this repository and running the dev-environment.sh script in the [Setup Folder](./setup "Setup Bash Script") to install all dependencies, setup Git and run the project.

There is also a Vagrant deployment utilizing Ubuntu as a way to ensure environment consistency in a development team or to easily work with remote teams.

###Ensure Best Practices
Keep the code clean and follow a few best practices and in the long run your team and your business will thank you. One of the main goals of BlackMesa is to reduce technical debt as much as possible by taking a proactive approach to development. Altough the linting programs help, they are no substitue for a *proper review process*.

###Keep It Modular
Everything is a module or a component of some sort and can and *SHOULD* be swapped to fit the project's needs.

###Performance & Mobile First
Lets face it, we all hate slow websites on mobile - so why would we build slow websites ourselves? This project takes performance seriously.
